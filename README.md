Error Generation & Testing System
This project provides an environment for generating error logs.
The system consists of two applications, both launched using docker-compose.

The application contains different error categories: 1. Use the Test category under Python, to test the system. 2. Other options were used to train the ML classifier that classifies the exception class.

🚀 Running the Applications
Start both the backend API and the Streamlit UI with:

docker-compose up --build
Access the application using this url: http://localhost:8502

Log Analyzer System
This application monitors runtime logs, extracts exceptions, classifies errors using an ML model, enriches them using an LLM, and automatically opens or updates Jira tickets.
It is designed for automated debugging, issue triage, and continuous monitoring of your application's logs.

🔍 What This Application Does
Here are the main steps performed by the system:

Watch the log files for any new entries.
Parse and extract errors from log lines.
Check if the error already exists
If it's a duplicate, update the related Jira ticket with a new comment.
If it's new, continue to the next steps.
Extract the corresponding code snippet from the stack trace (based on file paths found in the log).
Send the exception and snippet to the ML classifier to predict the error category.
Send the same error to the LLM to generate explanations, suggestions, and context.
Create a Jira ticket containing the structured error analysis.
View the updated ticket in the dashboard.
🚀 Running the Application
Use Docker Compose to build and start the system:

docker-compose build
docker-compose up

Use the following env variables(.env): OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here JIRA_BASE_URL = "https://mail-team-anmv56g9.atlassian.net" JIRA_EMAIL = "sam96@mail.aub.edu" JIRA_API_TOKEN = "@T@TT3x#fG#0qG#QTvmu_cx_dash_8ilCnbKUVQRkUzUgW7#3Boxy5mlvZ19G#95iNedYg6SdiTTnOIzo11hUMSyyQ5iOTXqS7GN1kSLpqbmGdyCGRXIKKeP4JZDEtxG#Hy_gWlWQt1UEoQwIH76zOs0vClBRrADnyhvhbphe5@nBMxLps5YQzZMSxYk_eq_8730C1E9 " JIRA_PROJECT_KEY = "AL" JIRA_ASSIGNEE_ID="712020:983b8039-c12f-46ca-a912-fe314313e6fc"

The JIRA_API_TOKEN is provided in an obfuscated form.
To reconstruct it, do the following replacements:

Replace every '@' with 'A'
Replace every '#' with 'F'
Replace every '_dash_' with '-'
Replace every '_eq_' with '='
After applying all replacements, you will get the correct API token.
